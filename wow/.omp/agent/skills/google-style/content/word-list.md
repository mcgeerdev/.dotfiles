**Changes made:** HTML converted to Markdown; site navigation, language selector, generated
page summaries, and page footers removed; site-relative links rewritten as absolute URLs;
each page's headings demoted one level so the page nests under this file's title; multiple
pages combined into this file. The guidance text is not rewritten, summarized, or reordered,
though the HTML-to-Markdown conversion reflows line breaks and table layout. Notices
(`<aside>` elements) are rendered as blockquotes.

## Word list

> **Note**: This document includes references to potentially disrespectful or offensive terms.
> These terms are listed here to provide usage guidance and alternative terms.

This word list covers style and usage guidelines that are specific to developer documentation.

If the term that you're looking for isn't on this list, check our other [editorial resources](https://developers.google.com/style#editorial-resources), including our preferred
dictionary, [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/). If there are multiple spellings in
the Merriam-Webster word entry, use the first form listed, which is the most common spelling. For
example, in the [entry for _cancel_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/canceled),
the first form listed for the past tense is _canceled_, indicating that it's more common than _cancelled_.

If you're looking for a technical definition, then it's often a good idea to check the
authoritative documentation on the topic.

Terminology decisions, including how and when to define or contextualize
terms, often require judgments based on factors like your product area,
your audience, and prevailing convention. Here are some other pages of this
guide that can help you make those types of judgments:

- [Jargon](https://developers.google.com/style/jargon)
- [Inclusive language](https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation)
- [Write for a global audience](https://developers.google.com/style/translation)
- [Hyphens](https://developers.google.com/style/hyphens)
- [Capitalization](https://developers.google.com/style/capitalization)

As always, it's fine to deviate from our guidance if that serves your readers
better. For more information, see [Break the rules](https://developers.google.com/style#rules).

### Word list

All word list entries have a link link
icon next to them. To link directly to an entry, you can right-click and
copy the link address, or click and copy the URL from your address bar.

Some word list entries include guidance to _avoid_ or _don't use_ a
term. Apply this guidance as follows:

- **Use with caution**. A recommendation to avoid using the term _when
  possible_, or to use the term with caution. The term might be ambiguous
  or obscure, so we provide alternative term suggestions or suggest that you
  use a more specific term. However, you can use the term if needed. Where
  appropriate, define the term or use it only once, as explained on the [Jargon](https://developers.google.com/style/jargon) page.
- **Don't use**. In all cases, we prefer to _not use the term_. The
  term might be particularly ambiguous or it might have an offensive or
  non-inclusive association. If such a term appears in code, we recommend that
  you [replace or write around the term](https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation#replace-or-write-around-non-inclusive-terms).
- **Android**. Applies only to Android documentation.
- **Google Cloud**. Applies only to Google Cloud documentation.
- **Google Workspace**. Applies only to Google Workspace documentation.

Don't use _API_ when referring to a method or a class. For example,
don't write _This resource has one API_ to mean "This resource has
one method."

API Console, APIs console,
developer console, dev console, or Google API Console [link](#api-console)
Don't use. Instead, refer to the _Google APIs Explorer_ or to the _Google Cloud console_. For more information, see [console](#console).

and use _authorized_ only to refer to requests that are sent by a
client app on behalf of an authenticated user.

A user _authenticates_ their identity by entering their password
(or giving some other proof of identity). The _authenticated

things:

Recommended: JavaScript introduces
dependencies between the DOM, the CSSOM, and JavaScript execution.

Use _among_ when you're talking about things that are part of a group
or things that aren't distinct:

Recommended: ... a conventional SQL
database that can be shared among multiple apps.

More examples:

dimensions vary widely between devices (for example, between phones and
tablets, and even between different phones), you should configure the
viewport so that your pages render correctly on many different devices.

Instead, use _billed charges_.

Use _billing charges_ to describe the cost of creating the bill.

black-box [link](#black-box)
Avoid using _black-box_, _blackbox_, or _black box_ to
describe monitoring and testing. Consider using a more precise term for
clarity. - For monitoring, use _synthetic monitoring_.

Black Friday [link](#black-friday)
Avoid unless explicitly referring to an event in the US. Instead use _peak scale event_.

blackhat, black hat, black-hat [link](#blackhat)
Don't use. Instead, use precise terms for the kind of violation or
practice, such as _illegal_, _unethical_, or _in violation of
rules_.

blackhole (verb), blackholed (adjective) [link](#blackhole)
Don't use. Instead, use a more descriptive term or phrase, such as _dropped without notification_.

blacklist, black list, black-list [link](#blacklist)
Don't use _blacklist_, _whitelist_, and _graylist_.
Instead, use more precise terms that are appropriate for your domain.

- For the noun _blacklist_, consider using a replacement such as _denylist_, _excludelist_, or _blocklist_.
- For the noun _whitelist_, consider using a replacement such as _allowlist_, _trustlist_, or _safelist_.
- For the noun _graylist_ (_greylist_), consider using a
  replacement such as _provisional list_.

In all of these cases, consider that there might not actually be a list
involved. When replacing problematic terms, be sure to be technically
accurate for the specific context.

For the verb forms of these words, a simple word-for-word replacement
typically isn't the best solution. Instead, replace verbs such as _blacklisted_ with phrases that accurately convey the relevant
action. For example:

Recommended: To deny requests from
an IP address, add it to the `dos.yaml` file.

Not recommended: To denylist an IP
address, add it to the `dos.yaml` file.

Don't use: To blacklist an IP
address, add it to the `dos.yaml` file.

If the command or code that you're documenting uses one of these words,
then use the words only in direct reference to the code items
([formatted as code](https://developers.google.com/style/code-in-text)), and make it clear
what you're referring to.

Recommended: Add a user to the
allowlist (`whitelist`) by entering the following: `whitelist adduser *EMAIL_ADDRESS*`.

Not recommended: Add a user to the
whitelist by entering the following: `whitelist adduser
        *EMAIL_ADDRESS*`.

blast radius [link](#blast-radius)
Don't use. Instead, use a more precise term like _affected area_ or _spatial impact_.

blind [link](#blind)
Avoid using _blind to_ or _blind eye to_. Instead, use more
precise terms like _ignore_, _unaware of_, _disregard_, _avoid_, or _reject_.

Avoid using _blind writes_. Instead, use a more precise phrase, such
as _a write operation without a read operation_.

Avoid using _blind change_ or _change blindly_. Instead, use a
more precise phrase such as _change without first confirming the
value_.

When referring to people, use terms like _person who is blind_, _screen reader user_ (if applicable), _person who is visually
impaired_, _person who is low-vision_, _magnification user_ (if applicable).

blue-green [link](#blue-green)
Not _blue/green_ or _blue green_.

boolean [link](#boolean)
In most contexts, _boolean_ refers to a specific data type in a
specific programming language. In such cases, use code font and the exact

If you refer to _Boolean mathematics_ or _Boolean logic_, use
uppercase.

branding information [link](#branding-information)
In the Google Cloud console, the phrase _branding information_ refers

build cop, build sheriff [link](#build-cop)
Don't use. Instead, use a more precise term like _build monitor_.

button [link](#button)
In a UI, a link isn't the same as a button; don't use the term _button_ to refer to a link.

Use _button_ to refer to mechanical buttons (like the volume control
buttons on the side of a phone) and capacitive touch buttons on a phone
(like the Home button). You _press_ mechanical buttons, and _tap_ capacitive and on-screen buttons.

use or provide a link to the definition, and use it consistently
throughout the document.

cell phone, cellphone [link](#cell-phone)

config [link](#config)
Avoid when possible. Instead, spell out the full word when it's used in a
non-code sense: _configuration_ or _configuring_. Use the
verbatim code item name when referring to, for example, a data structure
or a file with that name.

confidential [link](#confidential)

Site reliability engineering (SRE) content generally refers to
measuring _customer happiness_ instead of _customer
satisfaction_. The two phrases are not equivalent.

The distinction the SRE documentation makes is between satisfying a need
(a dispassionate act) and establishing an emotional response (creating
happiness). Although it is difficult to measure happiness precisely, SRE
uses [service level indicators (SLIs)](#service-level-indicator) to quantify user perception. For example, a customer might feel
a "need" to watch a show on TV. If the show is available, the customer's
need is satisfied. But if playback is slow or choppy, the customer might
not be happy.

For more information about SRE and measuring reliability, see [The Happiness Test](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/site-reliability-engineering-slos/the-happiness-test-ELmSr).

hardcode (verb), hardcoded (adjective) [link](#hardcode)
Don't hyphenate.

he, him, his [link](#he)
Don't use a gendered pronoun except for a specific individual of known
gender. Use _they_ and _their_ for the general singular pronoun.

healthcare [link](#healthcare)
Not _health care_ or _health-care_.

health check [link](#health-check)
Use with caution. When describing an action taken for a computer system,
only use the term _health check_ if this is the term that appears in
the interface. Be certain to remove any ambiguity regarding whether the
term refers to health in the medical sense.

Use detailed, non-figurative language as much as possible, such as
referring to a node _being responsive_ instead of referring to a node
being healthy.

healthy [link](#healthy)
Don't use. See [health check](#health-check).

high availability (noun), high-availability (adjective) [link](#high-availability)
Spell as _high availability_ when used as a noun and as _high-availability_ when
used as an adjective. See also [load balancing (noun), load-balancing (adjective)](#load-balancing).

Lowercase except when part of a product name, but OK to abbreviate as _HA_ after first use.

higher [link](#higher)
Don't use for a range of version numbers. Instead, use [_later_](#later).

Don't use to refer to a position in a document. Use _earlier_ or _preceding_.

Don't use to refer to a position in the UI. Instead, write instructions
that avoid directional language. For more information, see [Writing accessible documentation](https://developers.google.com/style/accessibility).

In Android documentation, use _higher_ for a range of version numbers, not _later_.

A release with the highest version number might not be the latest version.
For example, if version 2.0 of an operating system receives a bug-fix
update after version 3.0 has been released, then version 2.0.1 might be
the latest version, even though its version number is lower than 3.0.

high performance computing (HPC) [link](#high-performance-computing)
Don't hyphenate. Lowercase except at the beginning of a sentence,
heading, or list item.

hit [link](#hit)
Don't use as a synonym for _click_, _press_, or _type_.

hold the pointer over [link](#hold-the-pointer-over)
Only use this verb phrase in the following cases:

…

- To decide whether it's more appropriate to use _if_ or _whether_, see [Grammar Girl's discussion of _if_ and _whether_](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/if-versus-whether).

- When the user needs to hold their mouse over a UI element, but not
  click the UI element. This action involves waiting for the UI to
  react—for example, waiting for a tooltip to open or waiting for a
  submenu to open.
- When the duration of time is important.

The phrase _point to_ is more common.

See also [point to](#point-to).

Recommended: In the **Admin** menu, hold the pointer over **File**, and then click **New**.

Not recommended: In the **Admin** menu, hover over **File**, and then click **New**.

holiday, the holidays [link](#holiday)

hostname [link](#hostname)
Not _host name_.

hot [link](#hot)
When possible, avoid [jargon](https://developers.google.com/style/jargon) like _hot failover_, _hot standby_, and _hot spare_. If you use one of these phrases,
define it on first use and use it consistently throughout the document. However, see [hotspot](#hotspot).

hotspot[link](#hotspot)
In databases, _hotspots_ occur when a small number of nearby rows are
accessed frequently in a short period of time, causing CPU spikes and
affecting performance. Use _hotspot_ and _hotspots_ as nouns.
Don't use verb and gerund forms such as _hotspotting_, because they
translate less consistently.

When you use _hotspot_, define it the first time that you use it on
a page as you normally do with jargon.

Recommended: Hotspots in one table
can affect the performance of other tables.

Not recommended: Hotspotting in one
table can affect the performance of other tables.

housekeeping, house keeping, house-keeping [link](#housekeeping)

if [link](#if)
Wondering whether to use _if_ or _whether_? See [whether](#whether).

Although it is common in casual usage to omit the word _then_ in _if...then_ statements, you should include helper words like _then_ in technical documentation. For
more information, see [Use clear, precise, and unambiguous language](https://developers.google.com/style/translation#clear-language).

image [link](#image)
_Image_ by itself doesn't localize well because of its many meanings. Consider adding
context—for example, _disk image_ or _container image_.

impact_, use the word _affect_.

Recommended: This issue affects
user experience.

Use only to refer to a glitch or problem with graphics that is caused by a loss of data or
inadequate refresh rate. Don't use otherwise. Use a less figurative term to refer to something
of poor or unreliable quality.

just [link](#just)
Avoid. Usually, _just_ is a filler word that you can delete without
affecting your meaning.

Recommended: BigQuery skips the row.

Not recommended: BigQuery just skips
the row.

If your meaning is unclear without _just_, then use a more specific
term such as _only_, _instead_, or _previously_, or revise
your language to be more specific. (Even if one of these replacement
terms fits, you often don't need it.)

Use for a range of version numbers, not _higher_.

Recommended: Use version 2.2 or
later.

higher.

Not recommended: Use version 2.2+.

A release with the highest version number might not be the latest version.
For example, if version 2.0 of an operating system receives a bug-fix
update after version 3.0 has been released, then version 2.0.1 might be
the latest version, even though its version number is lower than 3.0.

In Android documentation, don't use _later_ for a range of version numbers. Instead, use _higher_.

When referring to a position in a document, use _later_ or _following_, not _below_.

latest [link](#latest)
Avoid in timeless documentation because this word can become outdated.

If you must use _latest_, give the reader a reference
point—for example, a version number or release date.

Hyphenate when referring to a Google Cloud location that consists of more
than one region.

You can use _multi-regional_ as an adjective in the context of
multi-regions, but consider _multi-region_ as
an attributive noun instead, such as in "The dataset is in the EU
multi-region location." Use _multiregional_ in other contexts.

multi-service [link](#multi-service)
Hyphenate. We generally prefer to close prefixed words, but this is

The term _native_ isn't necessarily clear—for example, _cloud-native_ could mean that something was written for the cloud,
or that it's built in to a cloud platform, or that it currently exists in
a cloud platform.

Alternatives to a term like _cloud-native_ could include: _modern cloud_, _born in the cloud_, _cloud first_, and _cloud-born_.

network IP address [link](#network-ip-address)
Don't use. Instead, use _internal IP address_.

new, newer [link](#new)
Avoid in timeless documentation because this word can become outdated.

_New_ also implies that the reader knows the older product and that
labeling something as _new_ is therefore meaningful.

If you must use _new_, give the reader a reference point—for
example, a version number or release date.

Don't use _newer_ to refer to a specific version of a product.
Instead, use [_later_](#later). Make sure that you provide

scale [link](#scale)
Don't use _scale_ alone to say that something is large or increasing.

If the command or code that you're documenting uses the literal word _slave_, then use this word only in direct reference to the code item
([formatted as code](https://developers.google.com/style/code-in-text)), make it clear what
you're referring to, and use the new term thereafter. For example, "Invoke
the secondary (`slave`) process directly when debugging issues
between the primary and secondary processes."

See also [master](#master).
